SIMBA: An Efficient Simulator for Blockchain Applications
==============================

SIMBA is built on top of BlockSim (a framework for modeling and simulating a Blockchain protocol) by adding the Merkle tree feature to blockchain nodes. This makes it more efficient and allows us to perform more realistic evaluations that are not possible with the base tool. Results of our experiments show that the inclusion of Merkle trees has a high impact of up to 30 times reduction in the verification time of blocks' transactions without an impact on block propagation delay. Since block verification is a critical part of a node computational job, its performance significantly affects the overall performance of each node in the network.


Clarification
======

Pleasse note that our simulator has no connection with the company SIMBA Chain Inc. that focuses on creating blockchain applications, where SIMBA (Simple Blockchain Applications) is a platform to deploy a blockchain network.
